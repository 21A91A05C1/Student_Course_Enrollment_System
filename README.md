# Student_Course_Enrollment_System

## Overview
This Java application is designed to manage student enrollment, course details, and tuition payments within an educational institution. The application provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to perform various tasks related to student management.

## Project Features
- **Student Enrollment**: Allows administrators to enroll new students by providing their personal details and selecting courses.
- **Course Management**: Enables administrators to view available courses, add new courses, and update existing course information.
- **Tuition Payment**: Facilitates tuition payment processing for enrolled students, including viewing balance and making payments.
- **Dynamic User Interface**: Utilizes console-based user interface for interaction, featuring clear prompts and messages for user guidance.

## Technologies Used
- Java SE
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## Project Structure
The project is structured into multiple Java classes to encapsulate different functionalities:
- `StudentDatabaseApp.java`: Main class to run the application.
- `Student.java`: Class representing individual student details and actions.
- `ConsOverload.java`: Class demonstrating constructor overloading.
- `overriding.java`: Class demonstrating method overriding.
- `Demo.java`: Subclass inheriting from `overriding` class and overriding its method.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
3. Run the `StudentDatabaseApp.java` file to start the application.
4. Follow the prompts to enroll students, manage courses, and process tuition payments.

## Future Improvements
While the current version of the application serves as a basic Student Management System, future enhancements may include:
- Integration with External Systems: Implementing integration with external systems or APIs for additional functionality.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Developing a graphical interface for enhanced user interaction and visualization.
- Enhanced Error Handling: Improving error handling mechanisms to provide better feedback to users.
